<p>I’ve started going through the 2016 benthic photos from Carrie Bow and have refined the color-correction process that I was using on previous photos analysed for 2017 <a href="http://www.whippolab.com/labnotebook/2017/12/05/benthic-photo-processing-for-coralnet/">here</a>. I used the same methods and got through CBC 30 Central, but I added a color-correction step after I applied the red filter. I also changed the opacity of the red layer independently for each photo (I used the same opacity for all pictures within a site previously.) The results were much better and I was able to remove some of the magenta (though not all.) <br><br></p>

<p>Photo from CBC 30 Central in 2016 before (left), and after (right) color correction. <br><br></p>
<p>Next I will attempt to crop the photos to 82cm x 54cm. The CBC 30 Central photos that I color-corrected were from separate surveys conducted by CCRE. The MarineGEO photos often lacked scale or weren’t big enough for pre-processing.</p>
