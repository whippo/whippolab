<p>This week I got back to processing the benthic photoquadrats from the 2017 MarineGEO Carrie Bow Cay field campaign. I reviewed the 2015 photos which we uploaded to <a href="https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/">CoralNet</a> and saw that some of the photos were not color-corrected. I also double checked the cropping of the photos and found that most photos were cropped to a 54cm x 82cm estimated area covered, though some photos appear to be larger that that. I will need to investigate this further.</p>
<p>To process the 2017 photos from Carrie Bow Reef, House Reef, Carrie Bow Patch Reef, Curlew Patch Reef, South Reef, and Tobacco Reef I decided to standardized color correction using GIMP v2.8.18 following a protocol modified from the Script Fu provided at the bottom.</p>
<p>My manual process was:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the color correction tool Colors&gt;Levels&gt;Auto</li>
<li>Make 3 dupicates of the base image in layers (counted from the top 3,2,1,base)</li>
<li>Fill layer 2 with gray (HTML notation: #808080)</li>
<li>Change layer 3 mode to ‘Value’</li>
<li>Merge layer 3 down to layer 2</li>
<li>Create duplicate of new layer 2 (makes new layer 3)</li>
<li>Fill new layer 3 with red (HTML notation: #ff0000)</li>
<li>Change layer 3 mode to ‘Multiply’</li>
<li>Merge layer 3 down to layer 2</li>
<li>Change new layer 2 mode to ‘Screen’</li>
<li>Merge layer 2 down to layer 1</li>
<li>Change layer opacity to create a ‘neutral’ tone
<ul>
<li>Carrie Bow Reef = 80%</li>
<li>House Reef = 40%</li>
<li>Carrie Bow Patch Reef = 60%</li>
<li>Curlew Patch Reef = 20%</li>
<li>South Reef = 20%</li>
<li>Tobacco Reef = 20%</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Layers were flattened (right-click on layer in dialogue -&gt; ‘Flatten Image’), and source file was overwritten.</li>
</ol>
<p>Photos were then imported to ImageJ v1.48 and scale was set using transect tape in the image. Images too small to crop to 82cm x 54cm or with no visible scale in the image were not cropped and excluded from anlaysis.</p>
