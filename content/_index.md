title: "Ross Whippo's Lab and Field Notebook"
---

<br><br>

Welcome to my field and lab notebook. I am currently the central technician for the Smithsonian's <a href ="http://marinegeo.si.edu/" target="_blank">MarineGEO</a> program, and will be returning to graduate school in Fall 2018 to pursue my PhD in marine community ecology. 

My primary interests include: trophic interactions of primary producers and consumers; the effects of cross-habitat nutrient subsidies; the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function; and dispersal. You can find my science-related blog posts on my <a href="http://www.rosswhippo.com/" target="_blank">personal website</a>.

The notebook contains field and lab observations, experimental setups, preliminary analyses and results, and other thoughts related to my work. Project specific code and data can be found on my <a href="http://www.github.com/whippo/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository.
